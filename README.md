## Introduction

This web application was designed with a mobile first approach in mind, with the main purpose to combine the fun of an interactive game with improving geography knowledge. 

I got my inspiration from the paper blank maps we had back in highschool where we had to guess the countries, as preparation for the Baccalaureate exam at Geography. Back then, I would have found it a lot more useful and more fun to study if there was a game or a web application as such instead of just paper maps. So with this idea in mind I have made this web application.

This is also the second Milestone Project a student must complete as part of the Web Applications Development Program at Code Institute.

The main requirements were to make an interactive web application using primarily **HTML5**, **CSS3** and **Vanilla Javascript**.

## UX 

### Ideal User Demographic
#### The ideal user of this web application is:
- New players
- Current players

### User Stories
#### New Players Goals:
1. Easily navigate through the web application to find information on how to play the game, play the game and get in touch with the developer.
2. Be able to find out easily how to play the game.
3. Find out who developed the game.
4. Easily get in touch with the developer for any queries.
5. Be able to prepare for the game.
6. Easily Restart the game or navigate back to the main page.
7. Know exactly what level of knowledge the player has after going through the whole length of the game.
8. Have fun as well as improving geography skills.
#### Current Players Goals:
1. Easily navigate through the content in order to play the game again.
2. Be able to get in touch easily with the developer.
3. Be able to restart the game anytime throughout they feel the need to start again.
4. Measure their knowledge at the end of every game.

### Development Planes
In order to develop and promote an interactive web application, Guess The Country has been created based on:
#### Strategy
The targeted audience:
- Students preparing for GCSE exam or A Levels at Geography.
- Students preparing for any other exam that requires relevant geographical knowledge.
- Individuals who want to test or improve their current knowledge.
- Individuals who want to be entertained by an interactive game.
- Age group: suitable for any age group

The **user** can use the web application for:
- Educational purposes, to prepare for an exam.
- Improving general knowledge on maps.
- Entertainment, as this web application is a multiple choice quiz.
- Getting in touch with the developer for any queries or suggestions via contact form.
- Get in touch with the developer via social media platforms.

The **developer** can use the web application to:
- Improve their own geography skills, as this is a game the developer will play themselves.
- Add a new application to their portfolio.
- Improve their newly learned languages and skills.
- Learn how to use an API.

#### Scope
After defining the strategy, the scope was developed based on the following requirements:
- **User Requirements**
     - The user will be looking to:
          - Play a fun and interactive game.
          - Information about how to play the game.
          - How to get in touch with the developer.
          - Easily navigate through the application through minimum of clicks.
          - Improve their general knowledge on maps.
          - Choose the correct answer from a selection of multiple answers.
          - Know exactly how many answers has guessed right in order to correctly measure knowledge.
          - Restart the game anytime they feel necessary or play again.
- **How the user requirements have been met**
     - The user will be able to:
          - Navigate through the site with minimum clicks in order to find the information they want or to play the game.
          - Be able to find links to external sites in order to connect with the developer on social media.
          - Play the game for as many times as they want in order to achieve the desired level of knowledge.
          - Get in touch with the developer through a form that automatically sends the message to the developers personal inbox.

#### Structure
With the previously identified strategy and scope, the ideal structure was agreed to match the following diagram:

### Design

#### Typography
The fonts used are [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto "Link to Roboto Google Font") for the Logo situated on the Main page with Sans Serif as the fallback in case of import failure and Consolas font is used for the buttons, questions and answers throughout the game.


#### Imagery
The images selected have been used with a main purpose of highlighting the profile of the application, which is a geography related quiz.

The background images used on the main page, respectively on the 404 error page have been sourced by [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/ "Link to https://unsplash.com/").

The background image used on the quiz page has been sourced from [WallpaperAccess](https://wallpaperaccess.com/ "Link to https://www.wallpaperaccess.com").

The Map of Europe in SVG format has been sourced from [SimpleMaps](https://https://simplemaps.com/ "Link to https://www.simplemaps.com") and edited by the developer in [Figma](https://https://figma.com/ "Link to https://www.figma.com") in order to get each country attribute (ex: vector id).
